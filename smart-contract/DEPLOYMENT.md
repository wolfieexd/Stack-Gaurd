## üß™ Testing the Enhanced Contract

### Deploy to Devnet

```bash
# Navigate to smart contract directory
cd smart-contract

# Check contract syntax
clarinet check

# Test contract functions
clarinet console

# Deploy to devnet
clarinet deploy --devnet
```

### Test Core Functions

```clarity
;; 1. Submit a threat report with staking
(contract-call? .security-monitor submit-threat-report 
  'ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5 
  u8 
  "critical" 
  "malware-distribution" 
  u95 
  "abc123hash..." 
  u1000000)

;; 2. Verify a threat report
(contract-call? .security-monitor verify-threat-report 
  'ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5 
  "verify" 
  "Evidence of malicious activity" 
  u50)

;; 3. Monitor a transaction
(contract-call? .security-monitor monitor-transaction 
  'ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5 
  u100000000000 
  "large-transfer")

;; 4. Get comprehensive security status
(contract-call? .security-monitor get-security-status 
  'ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5)
```

## üîó Frontend Integration

Update your frontend to use the new enhanced functions:

```javascript
// Example integration with new features
async function submitEnhancedThreatReport(address, riskScore, evidence) {
  const stakeAmount = 1000000; // 1 STX
  
  const txOptions = {
    contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    contractName: 'security-monitor',
    functionName: 'submit-threat-report',
    functionArgs: [
      principalCV(address),
      uintCV(riskScore),
      stringAsciiCV("critical"),
      stringAsciiCV("malware-distribution"),
      uintCV(95),
      stringAsciiCV(evidence),
      uintCV(stakeAmount)
    ]
  };
  
  return await openContractCall(txOptions);
}
```
